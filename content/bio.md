Hello 👋

I'm a PhD student living in Toulouse, France 🇫🇷. I'm half British 🇬🇧 and half Belgian 🇧🇪. My university background is a mix of maths, economics, and computer science. My PhD is at the intersection of database query optimisation and machine learning 🤖. I try to build an interest in different topics so as to avoid becoming a one-trick pony 🐴. As of now, I'm particularly interested in [incremental learning](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Incremental_learning).

I enjoy writing code and I maintain [a few open-source projects](https://github.com/MaxHalford/). I also like doing [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/maxhalford). If you have any questions or want some data science consultancy work done, then feel free to shoot me an email at [maxhalford25@gmail.com](mailto:maxhalford25@gmail.com).

Besides work, I enjoy spending time with my friends and my girlfriend, reading, walking, looking at -- and sometimes making -- modern art, and cooking. My favorite beer is Guinness and my favorite food is peanut butter 🥜. I have a [brother](https://jack.0x5.be/) who's into physics and operating systems. My mother runs a quirky restaurant in the French countryside called the [Ziboinboin](https://ziboinboin.com/).
