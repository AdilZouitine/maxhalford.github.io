Hello 👋

I'm a PhD student living in Toulouse, France 🇫🇷. I'm half British 🇬🇧 and half Belgian 🇧🇪. My university background is a mix of maths, economics, and computer science. I got into data science after watching [*Moneyball*](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Moneyball_(film)) ⚾. My PhD is at the intersection of database query optimisation and machine learning 🤖. I try to build an interest in different topics, so as to avoid becoming a one-trick pony 🐴. As of late, I'm especially interested in [online machine learning](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Online_machine_learning).

I enjoy writing code and I [maintain some open-source projects](https://github.com/MaxHalford/). In particular, I'm the author of [creme](https://github.com/creme-ml/creme), which is a Python 🐍 library for online machine learning. I'm also a [Kaggle Master](https://www.kaggle.com/maxhalford) and enjoy competitive data science.

Besides work, I like spending time with my friends and my girlfriend, reading 📚, watching movies 🍿, walking, looking at -- and sometimes making -- modern art, and cooking 🍲. My favorite food is peanut butter 🥜 and my favorite beer is Guinness ☘️. I have a [brother](https://jack.0x5.be/) who's into physics and operating systems. My mother runs a quirky restaurant in the French countryside called the [Ziboinboin](https://ziboinboin.com/).

If you have any enquiries or simply want to get in touch, then feel free to shoot me an email at [maxhalford25@gmail.com](mailto:maxhalford25@gmail.com).
