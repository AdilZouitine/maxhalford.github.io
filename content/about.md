I'm a PhD student living in Toulouse, France. I studied a mix of maths, economics, and computer science at university. My PhD is at the intersection of database query optimisation and machine learning.

I enjoy writing code and I maintain [a few open-source projects](https://github.com/MaxHalford/). I also like doing [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/maxhalford). If you have any questions or want some consultancy work done, then feel free to shoot me an email at [maxhalford25@gmail.com](mailto:maxhalford25@gmail.com).

Besides work I enjoy spending time with my friends and my girlfriend, reading, walking, looking at -- and sometimes making -- modern art, and cooking. I have a [brother](http://jack.0x5.be/) who's into physics and operating systems (we're nerds, you guessed it). My mother runs a international cuisine restaurant called the [Ziboinboin](https://ziboinboin.com/) in the French countryside.
